// INSTRUCTIONS

// In a genetic algorithm, a population is a collection of candidates that may evolve toward a better solution.

// We determine how close a chromosome is to a ideal solution by calculating its fitness. https://www.codewars.com/kata/567b468357ed7411be00004a/train You are given two parameters, the population containing all individuals and a function fitness that determines how close to the solution a chromosome is.

// Your task is to return a collection containing an object with the chromosome and the calculated fitness.

// [
//   { chromosome: c, fitness: f },
//   { chromosome: c, fitness: f },
//   ...
// ]

// SOLUTION

const mapPopulationFit = (population, fitness) =>
  population.map((current) => ({
    chromosome: current,
    fitness: fitness(current),
  }));
